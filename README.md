Because of Github does not generate links for custom protocols like `sketch://`; you can copy & paste the url below, to your browser address bar.

```
sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fozgurgunes%2Fgo-design-system%2Fmaster%2Fgo-ui-library.rss

## Contribute

GO Design System uses Git hooks to commit, push & pull Sketch files as unzipped JSON sources. Fortunately, there is a small script to setup Git hooks for you automatically.

Run following commands

```
% git clone --recursive git@github.com:ozgurgunes/go-design-system.git
% cd go-design-system
% ./_hooks/setup.sh
```

Your clone is ready for Git actions. Checkout anything to generate Sketch files. You can use your favorite Git client too.

```
% git checkout master
```

Detailed documentation soon.
